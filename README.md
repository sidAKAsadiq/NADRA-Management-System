# NADRA-Management-System
This project marked our inaugural venture of the first semester, entirely constructed within a console-based framework and developed exclusively using the C programming language.

**Objective**:
Our primary objective was to apply programming fundamentals while ensuring the project's relevance within the current context. 

**Pursuit**:
We aspired to establish a National Database capable of addressing public needs and guaranteeing data credibility. Additionally, our focus was on data security. To this end, we introduced an early-stage file backup concept, safeguarding critical citizen information from potential loss.

**Attainment**:
Within a span of a few months, we successfully accomplished the project, showcasing key aspects akin to NADRA's functions. These included citizen verification, generation of pertinent reports, issuance of Family Registration Certificates (FRC), Computerized National Identity Cards (CNIC), as well as birth and marriage certificates, among other functionalities.

**Outcome**:
From an academic standpoint, our performance was exceptional, earning us a perfect score of 10/10. Yet, what proved even more rewarding was the realization that, by project's end, we had not only mastered the academic aspect but also created our inaugural programming project. This experience highlighted the significance of constructing projects from the ground up and the wealth of knowledge such endeavors can bestow.
